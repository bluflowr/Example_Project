## Example Project - DOD Full Stack Interview

This is a simple Django project with an API to pull sample Clinic data.
The Coding Exercise will encompass creating new API(s) and updating or creating models.

**Please fork or clone this project and review prior to your interview.**

If you are unfamiliar with Django, you may use the sqlite database in this repo to find the initial data and tables 
and use a language you are more familiar with to code with and discuss APIs and data stores. 

Useful files to review:

* [`clinics/models.py`](clinics/models.py)
* [`clinics/serializers.py`](clinics/serializers.py)
* [`clinics/views.py`](clinics/views.py)
